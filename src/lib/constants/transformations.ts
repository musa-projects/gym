      "When Jake walked into Big Vision, he weighed 110kg and couldn't run for 2 minutes. His doctor had warned him about his blood pressure and cholesterol. With the help of trainer Marcus and a structured nutrition plan, Jake committed to training 4 times per week. The first month was the hardest, but the community kept him going. At 8 months, he had lost 25kg, completed his first 10K race, and his blood work came back completely normal. Now he's training for a half marathon.",

      "Lisa came to Big Vision wanting to feel strong, not just thin. She had been doing only cardio for years and felt stuck. Marcus designed a progressive strength program for her, starting with basic compound movements and gradually increasing intensity. After 12 months, Lisa could deadlift 100kg, do 10 unassisted pull-ups, and had gained 8kg of lean muscle mass. More importantly, she says she's never felt more confident in her own skin.",

The CrossFit classes with Sarah pushed him in ways he didn't expect. Six months later, he could do 20 pull-ups, run a 5K in under 25 minutes, and had more energy than he'd had in 20 years. His kids now think he's a superhero.",

By adding two strength sessions per week and one HIIT class, Chris not only dropped 15 minutes from his marathon personal best but also gained noticeable muscle definition. He wishes he'd started cross-training years ago.",

Starting with basic bodyweight movements, Devon gradually built back his strength. At 14 months post-surgery, he squatted 120kg — more than he ever had. He's now one of the most inspirational members in the gym.",
